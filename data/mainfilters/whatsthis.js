        <div>
            Facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more per year of GHGs are required to annually report their GHG emissions to EPA. Roughly half of total U.S. GHG emissions are reported by direct emitters.
            <br/><br/>
            The data was reported to EPA by facilities as of 09/26/2020. EPA continues to quality assure data and plans to release updated data periodically.

        <div>
            Facilities report emissions from many process types defined by the GHGRP. Reporting requirements for each process type are contained in different subparts of the regulation.
            <br/><br/>
            Fuel Combustion emissions are defined as those reported under Subpart AA, Subpart D, and Subpart C except Subpart C emissions from use of sorbent which are given their own category. Emissions from Use of Carbonate are defined as those reported under Subpart U.
            <br/><br/>
            All other reported direct emissions are categorized as Process Emissions. Click here to learn more.
            <br/><br/>
            Emissions values presented by fuel type are not directly reported to EPA by facilities in all cases. Some values have been estimated by EPA based on publicly available reported data.
